# Cursor Rules for MCP Integration

## MCP Server Configuration
This project includes a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides:
- System information tools (secure, read-only)
- External API data fetching (JSONPlaceholder todos)

## Available Tools
- `get_system_info`: Get system information about the current environment
- `get_random_data`: Fetch random todo data from JSONPlaceholder API (todos 1-100)

## Usage Instructions
The AI assistant can now use these tools directly. For example:
- "Show me system information"
- "What's my current system information?"
- "Get details about my Node.js environment"
- "Fetch some random todo data"
- "Get todo data for ID 42"

## Security Note
✅ This MCP server is configured for security with read-only system information access.
✅ External API calls are limited to the JSONPlaceholder API for demo purposes.
✅ No file operations or command execution capabilities are available.
✅ Safe for use in any environment.

## MCP Integration
The server is configured in `.cursor/mcp.json` and provides secure system information and API data through the MCP protocol.
